    "### Priority Queues\n",
    "We are famailiar with the idea of queues. \n",
    "```\n",
    "Queues are FIFO or LILO abstract data type. Basically a collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But what is a priority queue?\n",
    "a priority queue is like a regular queue but each element has a \"priority\" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./priorityqueue.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One can imagine a priority queue as a modified queue, but when one would get the next element off the queue, the highest-priority element is retrieved first.\n",
    "Stacks and queues may be modeled as particular kinds of priority queues. As a reminder, here is how stacks and queues behave:\n",
    "stack – elements are pulled in last-in first-out-order (e.g., a stack of papers)\n",
    "queue – elements are pulled in first-in first-out-order (e.g., a line in a cafeteria)\n",
    "In a stack, the priority of each inserted element is monotonically increasing; thus, the last element inserted is always the first retrieved. In a queue, the priority of each inserted element is monotonically decreasing; thus, the first element inserted is always the first retrieved."

For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities and edge path costs represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. As a result, the shortest path algorithm is widely used in network routing protocols\n",
